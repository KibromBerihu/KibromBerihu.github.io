title: "Fast interactive medical image segmentation with weakly supervised deep learning method"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2020-09-01-interactive
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a fast, interactive, and weakly supervised deep learning framework for medical image segmentation. Combining a generative network for prior prediction with a CNN for refinement, the method achieved Dice scores up to 97% and processed 3D exams in 0.5 s. It demonstrated strong cross-modality adaptability and suitability for real-time image-guided interventions.'

excerpt: 'This paper reports the EMIDEC challenge on using deep learning for myocardial infarction assessment from DE-MRI. Automatic classification of exams as infarct or non-infarct achieved up to 92% accuracy, while myocardium segmentation was effective but struggled in diseased areas. The results show AI’s potential to improve cardiovascular MRI analysis, though further refinement is needed for clinical use.'

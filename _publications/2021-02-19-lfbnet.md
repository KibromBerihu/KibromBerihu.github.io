excerpt: 'This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, Learning with Context Feedback Loop (LFB-Net), for robust and accurate medical image segmentation. The method addresses challenges in capturing contextual information and inter-region relationships in medical images by integrating a feedback loop into the encoder-decoder architecture. The feedback loop allows the network to revisit and refine its segmentation predictions, improving accuracy and plausibility over time.

excerpt: 'AI was used to derive surrogate prognostic biomarkers (sTMTV, sDmax) from 2D PET MIP images in DLBCL. A CNN accurately segmented lesions, showing strong correlation with 3D PET/CT biomarkers. The AI-derived biomarkers predicted PFS and OS comparably to traditional methods while reducing computation time, demonstrating potential to streamline clinical workflows.'

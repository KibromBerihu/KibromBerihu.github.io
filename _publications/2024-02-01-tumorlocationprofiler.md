excerpt: 'This study introduces three PET/CT biomarkers—SpreadSpleen, Dspleen, and sDspleen—that quantify tumor spread relative to the spleen in DLBCL patients. These biomarkers predict progression-free and overall survival and improve the prognostic value of metrics like TMTV and age-adjusted IPI. Using AI-based spleen segmentation, the features are simple, interpretable, and potentially useful for clinical integration.'

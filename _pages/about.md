I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Curie, in the [Laboratory of Translational Imaging in Oncology (LITO)](https://lito-web.fr/en/)
, Paris-Saclay, France. My research focuses on developing generative models for medical image generation to enhance the segmentation of clinical targets and the prediction of tumor malignancy levels. This work is part of an industrial–academic collaboration between [GE Healthcare and LITO](https://www.gehealthcare.fr/solutions/aidream).


Before starting my postdoctoral research, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Bourgogne (France), within [ImViA](https://imvia.ube.fr/) and in collaboration with [CGFL](https://www.cgfl.fr/) (Dijon, France). My work focused on developing deep learning models for multimodal medical image analysis.

I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Program in [Computer Vision and Robotics](https://www.vibot.org/), a collaborative program among three European universities, [université bourgogne europe, France](https://www.ube.fr/), [University of Girona, Spain](https://www.udg.edu/en/), and [Heriot-Watt University, Scotland](https://www.hw.ac.uk/).

I completed my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mu.edu.et/index.php/undergraduate-programs/mekelle-institute-of-technology-undergraduate-programs)
